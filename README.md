- **Search & Filter:** Efficient searching and filtering options to easily find records.
  
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

- **Visual Studio 2022**: The IDE used for development. You can download it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
- **.NET Framework**: The application is built on .NET (version specific to your project).
- **SQL Server**: Used for database management. Install [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and ensure itâ€™s running.
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Optional but recommended for managing your database.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 2. Open in Visual Studio 2022
- Launch **Visual Studio 2022** on your system.
- From the top menu, go to `File -> Open -> Project/Solution`.
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory and select the `StaffMaster.sln` solution file.
- Once the project is opened, restore NuGet packages if prompted by Visual Studio.

### 3. Configure the SQL Database
- Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
- Create a new database named `StaffMaster` or another name of your choice.
- In the `/DatabaseScripts/` folder of the cloned repository, find the SQL scripts to set up your database.
    - Execute the **schema.sql** file to create tables.
    - Optionally, execute the **seed.sql** file to populate the database with initial data (e.g., test employees, roles).
- Open the `appsettings.json` (or `web.config` if it's a desktop application) in Visual Studio and locate the connection string section.

Example connection string in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "StaffMasterDB": "Server=your_server_name;Database=StaffMaster;User Id=your_user_id;Password=your_password;"
}

```
### 3. Configure the SQL Database
- Open **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.
- Create a new database named `StaffMaster` (or another name of your choice).
- Navigate to the `/DatabaseScripts/` folder in the cloned repository and find the following SQL scripts:
    - **schema.sql**: Contains the schema for creating the necessary tables.
    - **seed.sql** (optional): Contains sample data for testing purposes.
- Run the **schema.sql** script in SSMS to create the database tables.
- (Optional) Run the **seed.sql** script to populate the database with initial test data.
- In Visual Studio, open the `appsettings.json` (or `web.config` for desktop applications) and locate the connection string.

Example connection string in `appsettings.json`:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "StaffMasterDB": "Server=your_server_name;Database=StaffMaster;User Id=your_user_id;Password=your_password;"
}
```
